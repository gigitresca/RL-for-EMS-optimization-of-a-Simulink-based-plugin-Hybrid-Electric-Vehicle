This repository provides the code and methodology for setting up and training a Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) and a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to optimize the energy management of a plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). The implementation is built using MATLAB for the agent setting, training and testing, while the vehicle environment has been developed in Simulink.

The repository includes detailed explanations and modular code for:

- HEV backward kinematic model approach in Simulink
- SAC algorithm implementation using the Reinforcement Learning Toolbox of MATLAB
- Training and testing procedures
- Methodology to postprocess the output of the simulation

The code is designed to be modular, allowing for 
- Easy integration of new RL agents and new policy parametrizations
- Easy customization of the vehicle model environment
- Easy integration of different reward functions

## STAY TUNED!
The code will be available soon!!!!! ðŸš€
Weâ€™re working hard to finalize and share this resource. Check back here for updates!
